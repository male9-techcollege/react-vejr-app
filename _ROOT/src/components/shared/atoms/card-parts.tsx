    Experiments:
    --FAIL(S)--
    - When I had 
      switch (bodyContentFallbackByMariePierreLessard || bodyContent || children)
      only the fallback was displayed even though I provided the props. It's because the OR operator is exclusive.
      There is no AND/OR operator. The conditions must be read in order, too!
    --PARTIAL SUCCESS(ES)--
    - With 
      switch (undefined) 
      I can show the bodyContent or the children, but not both!
      This being said, TypeScript objects to the parameter being undefined.
