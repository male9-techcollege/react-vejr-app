    This button does NOT work in the stopwatch assignment (where it is a reset button)

    No argument is sent by this reset button.

    I found a clear explanation for that in the following source: 
    NetNinja, "Full Modern React Tutorial #7: Click Events" on YouTube 

    In a nutshell, 
    onClick={action}
    and
    onClick={() => action()}
    and
    onClick={() => {
        action();
    }}
    are equivalent because the variable "action" and the arrow function are not invoked/called on mounting.
    What is inside of the arrow function is only invoked/called if the arrow function is executed, which is what
    the on-click event listener does.
    The following is invoked on mounting because of the parentheses, which lead to the execution of that function
    as soon as the browser reads the code:
    onClick={action()}
  
    When I include the curly brackets of the arrow function, as follows, I can see why action must be followed by parentheses
    in an arrow function.
    onClick={() => {
        action();
    }}
    If there were no parenthesis, action would look like a variable with some other data type than function. 
    The parentheses are necessary to get the function executed.

    Kasper said that:
    if one writes handlerFunction(argument) in the onclick attribute without putting it in an arrow function, 
    the function is called even though the user did not click on the button. This only happens if the function takes arguments.
    Solution: just write handlerFunction. 
    Alternatively, use an arrow function: 
    onClick={() => handlerFunction} 
    Source: react-intro-mc-med-kasper
    
    Kasper said that it is a lot easier to define the action outside of the button component
    and pass it as a prop.
    Result: 
    onClick={toggleAction}
    Maybe TO DO (if useful in assignment): implement that in some use of the components for replacing 
    numbers and strings.
    Indeed, that is not how I already designed my interface for the toggle button, which worked in the colour-mode-switching 
    and stopwatch assignments. My interface requires a boolean value to be passed as a prop, and it is the button's event listener 
    that does the toggling.

    When the following function was in App(), until I used useCallback, there was an infinite loop when I accessed the page. 
    Kasper said that it's because I put the function in useEffect, which is the wrong thing to do, 
    and that I wasn't supposed to use the useEffect hook at all!
    
    From the sources below, I had (mis)understood/inferred that this has to do with how the setter's callback in a child component
    is re-rendered every time the parent is re-rendered. This can cause problems like an infinite loop on top of the fact that 
    the state controlled by the setter is reset by the re-rendering (as we learned in class) 
    unless the information about the state is stored somewhere. That is what useCallback does.
    Kasper said that the state of the children isn't ALWAYS reset when rerendering. It depends.
    He also said that useCallback solves problems that could be solved by making improving the code, e.g. by simplifying 
    the logic and making it more effective. He doesn't agree with the Hygraph.com article below. 
    
    const toggleColourModeByMariePierreLessard = useCallback(() => {
        setColourModeByMariePierreLessard(!colourModeByMariePierreLessard);
        console.log(colourModeByMariePierreLessard);
    }, [colourModeByMariePierreLessard]);
    
    Sources for the use of the useCallback hook: 
    
    "use the useCallback hook, which makes sure that the function you pass as a callback to the child component remains stable 
    across renders, preventing unnecessary re-renders and improving performance."
    https://dev.to/bcostaaa01/how-to-pass-props-from-child-to-parent-component-in-react-1ci4
    
    I probably encountered the 1st problem described in the citation below when I did react-joke-fetcher, even though the fix
    was not to use the useCallback hook.
    "Stale closures
    Callback functions can sometimes capture outdated values from their previous value, leading to bugs that are difficult 
    to track and fix. (...)
    useCallback() is a part of the built-in React Hooks that optimizes the performance of React applications by preventing 
    unnecessary re-renders of components. It achieves this through memoizing callback functions, ensuring that they are only 
    recreated when the dependency array changes.
    Syntax and parameters (...)
    The useCallback() Hook takes two arguments:
    1. Callback function: This is the first argument, and it represents the function to memorize (remember).
    2. Dependency array: This second argument is an array of dependencies that determine when the callback function should be 
    recreated. If any value in this array changes between renders, the callback function is recreated. (...)
    This means that as long as the dependencies don't change, the exact same function instance is returned every time 
    the component re-renders. (...)
    When to use useCallback()
    Here are some scenarios where using useCallback() is particularly beneficial:
    - Optimizing performance in lists: When rendering a list of items, you might need to pass a callback to each item. Using 
    useCallback() ensures that the same callback instance is passed to each item, preventing unnecessary re-renders.
    - When a callback is a dependency in useEffect(): Use useCallback() when the callback is a dependency in a useEffect Hook 
    to prevent the effect from running unnecessarily.
    - When working with custom Hooks: Use useCallback() to ensure consistent function references when creating custom Hooks 
    that return callback functions, especially if these other functions will be used as dependencies in effects.
    - Preventing stale closures: When a callback function depends on state or props, using useCallback() helps to ensure 
    the function always has the latest values.
    - Passing callbacks to child components: If the function references change, the child components may re-render unnecessarily. 
    useCallback() helps prevent this by memoizing the function, ensuring it only changes when its dependencies change."

    /* Experiments to understand puzzling behaviour (in dynamic-button assignment):
    
    The button (from assignment "Lav en dynamisk knap" (section 2.7, assignment 4)) 
    works perfectly fine: it changes the colour mode every time, also on the first click on the button.
    However, the boolean value printed with the following is not the one that I expected. 
    
    When this is in the scope of the button component, I get the following result whether or not I use the useCallback hook:
    the first time I click on the button, the boolean value is false (I can see that printed in the console). The second time,
    it is true. Why? Indeed, the toggle action (toggleAction(!theme);) is supposed to turn the initial falsy value of theme 
    into a truthy value. 
         
    Tests:
    1. If I comment toggleAction(!theme); out, false is still printed to the console on the first click on the button.
       Since there is no toggle function, subsequent clicks also print the word false. This shows that the value of the theme
       argument, passed from App() is the initial false value defined by useState in App().
    2. If I remove  theme  from the dependency array of useCallback, the toggle stops working. 
       Printed text is "Boolean value: false" at each click.
    3. Probable reason: this doesn't log the value of theme after it got changed by the setter. It logs the initial value,
       even though the line 
       console.log("Boolean value: ", theme);
       comes after it.
