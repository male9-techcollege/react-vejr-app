/* IMPORTANT NOTE: 
Cards have their own flex-container declarations because the general-use, higher-level containers in 
atoms/flex-container.module.scss 
have margins, which cards should not have since they are normally inside of a container with multiple cards in them,
and that container typically has the necessary margins, padding, and gaps.
*/

/* TO DO LATER, maybe in a diff. project: 
The following is project-specific rather than library styling, I think, because of the padding in the cards.
(In this exercise, the cards only contain text, not pictures that fill the whole width.) 
When displaying images, e.g. in a gallery, padding is optional because the cards don't have to be spaced out,
and images can go in a flex container or grid with gaps and/or what I call a passe-partout (as in a picture frame).
The library cards should either be without padding or exist in multiple versions. */

        but some styling, e.g. the flex-box styling, isn't inherited!

        Instead of repeating the same @include rule, I could have used the following, as is or as a mixin: 
        display: inherit;
        flex-direction: inherit;
        gap: inherit;
        justify-content: inherit;
        align-items: inherit;

        However, it is less confusing (more readable) to reuse the same mixin. 

        Another (rejected) option would have been to make the component to apply all the same props to the parent (link)
        and the first child (article). However, this would not have worked with all attributes to be applied to the
        anchor, the article, or vice versa. Too limiting!
