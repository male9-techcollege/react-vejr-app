// #region Research on generic interface to use with specific HTML elements
/* Based on the extensive sources provided for my image component (see file atoms/img-el.tsx), I simply guessed that 
HTMLElement had to go between the angle brackets (I was offline at the time). 
React doesn't seem to offer a generic interface specifically created for HTML elements like main and section 
(based on a quick search in the node_modules/@types/react/ts5.0/index.d.ts file). 
As a consequence, I am keeping the name of this type neutral to make it more reusable.
Ah! After a longer search in that file, I found the interface IntrinsicElements, which shows that quite a few HTML elements 
do use HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement>. Some also use an interface with another name between angle brackets (which should be 
the name of a type), such as HTMLAttributes<HTMLBodyElement>, HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>, 
HTMLAttributes<HTMLHeadingElement>, HTMLAttributes<HTMLParagraphElement>, HTMLAttributes<HTMLSpanElement>,
HTMLAttributes<HTMLUListElement>,  ...: 
- abbr (searching for abbrHTMLAttributes or HTMLAbbrElement gives no result)
- address (searching for addressHTMLAttributes gives no result)
- article (searching for articleHTMLAttributes gives no result)
- aside (searching for asideHTMLAttributes gives no result)
- b (searching for bHTMLAttributes gives no result)
- ...
Other options: 
- the interface AllHTMLAttributes (which extends the interface HTMLAttributes)
- the interface HTMLProps (which extends the interfaces AllHTMLAttributes and ClassAttributes)
- probably others
